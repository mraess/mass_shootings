## Mass shootings in the US

This is a shiny-dashboard to visualize mass shootings in the US from 1982 - 2018. The data come from Mother Jones' mass shootings database (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9o6uDO18sLxBqPwl_Gh9bnhW-ev_dABH83M5Vb5L8o/edit#gid=0).

The app accesses the google-doc directly, so whenever data is added, the app is updated automatically as well.
